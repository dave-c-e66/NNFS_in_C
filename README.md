# NNFS_in_C
Code from Neural Networks From Scratch book done in C
I will be working through the Neural Networks From Scratch Book (nnfs.io) but coding it in C instead of copying the Python code.
The goal is to better learn the material by having to write the code and at the same time improve my C programing.
